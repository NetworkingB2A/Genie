basic Git commands/terminology

create these first when you want to pull down config. This is meta data about youself, needed for git commands later on.
  - git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  - git config --global user.email "your_email@whatever.com"

git clone "hyperlink"
   - this is copy a git repository to your computer

git pull
  - this will pull the updates from a online repository to your local repository.

git pull request
  - This one messed with my head for a while, the following is the best way I think to explain it
  - if you make a change to someone else's source code and you want that change to be in the source code you submit a pull request.
  - Meaning you are asking them to pull your changes into their code.


git add (file name or directory location)
  - Also called Git stages
  - This is stage your commit and get them ready for commiting your change
  - You want to stage like code changes together and commit those changes at one time because you can add notes and look at different commits when auditing the code.

git status
  - This will tell you if your local git repository matches up with the main repository

git branch 
 - To understand this it really helps to understand how pointers work or cnames
 - a Cname is just an alias that points to the main domain name. you can make changes to the cname and never update the original record.
 - In this case i can creating an alias of the code, updating the alias. Then later i may ask my branch to update the main code
 - This actual code will show the branches i have, or i can create and delete my branches 

git checkout 
  - this will allow you to change between branches

git pull vs get fetch 
  - I dont really know yet.

The only two reasons i would use this next part is
  - because I dont want to log into the gui
  - I want to change my repository name

Creating a new repository
  - create a directory
    - mkdir train_git
    - cd train_git
    - touch "hello_world.txt"
  - create a new repository
    - git init
    - git add hello_world.txt
    - git commit -m "adding first file"
