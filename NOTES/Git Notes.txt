What is Git?
Git allows you to have version control of your software.
Git tracks changes to source code.




basic Git commands/terminology

create these first when you want to pull down config. This is meta data about youself, needed for git commands later on.
  - git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  - git config --global user.email "your_email@whatever.com"

Creating a new repository
  - create a directory
    - mkdir train_git
    - cd train_git
    - touch "hello_world.txt"
  - create a new repository
    - git init 
      - This will create a repository for your project. That repository is stored on your computer.
    - git add hello_world.txt  
      - This will create a snapshot of the project. you can add a single file or many files. This didnt create the snapshot. this is just the first step. this is acutally called the index in git.
    - git commit -m "adding first file" 
      - This will create a snapshot from your index, and this will add to your repository. good practice to give details about this commit. you should only commit the files that you want to change.

Data about your current git project ( I cant think of a better name yet.) 
  - git log 
    - this will show the history of the snapshot
  - git status 
    - This will tell you if your file are commited in your repository.
  - git diff (some commit id) (some other commit id )
    - this will show the differences in the git snapshots. if you want to see the differences in your commits your must put the commit code. you only need to see the first few digits and not the whole code.

git checkout (newer versions of git can use a get switch)
  git checkout (some commit id)
  - this will allow you to change between commits
  - this will take that commit and puts in our file system
  - in doing this you can grab your old commit that was working and have it fix a new bug that you may have introduced 


What is a Branch?




!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

git clone "hyperlink"
   - this is copy a git repository to your computer

git pull
  - this will pull the updates from a online repository to your local repository.

git pull request
  - This one messed with my head for a while, the following is the best way I think to explain it
  - if you make a change to someone else's source code and you want that change to be in the source code you submit a pull request.
  - Meaning you are asking them to pull your changes into their code.


git add (file name or directory location)
  - Also called Git stages
  - This is stage your commit and get them ready for commiting your change
  - You want to stage like code changes together and commit those changes at one time because you can add notes and look at different commits when auditing the code.



git branch 
 
 - To understand this it really helps to understand how pointers work or cnames
 - a Cname is just an alias that points to the main domain name. you can make changes to the cname and never update the original record.
 - In this case i can creating an alias of the code, updating the alias. Then later i may ask my branch to update the main code
 - This actual code will show the branches i have, or i can create and delete my branches 



git pull vs get fetch 
  - I dont really know yet.

The only two reasons i would use this next part is
  - because I dont want to log into the gui
  - I want to change my repository name
